# CuneiformTools

My library under construction for processing cuneiform languages and peforming somewhat complex operations on cuneiform texts, such as bracket position-sensitive substitutions. See documentation of what it can do [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kW9DnCpXGICJ_ttOCO182G2jivE7_knVOZP_v6vdNPw/)

This will be published as a Python module later on.
